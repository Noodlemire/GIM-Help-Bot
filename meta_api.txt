"Any":
	- Special Category (not a Meta value)
	- Roles of the "Any" category will be allowed to spawn regardless of a user's category specification.
	- Won't ignore subcategory specification or most other Meta fields
	- "Any" roles will be excluded from spawning 90% of the time to avoid overshadowing roles of smaller categories.
	- A user-specified category must still exist, or else "Any" roles won't spawn and an error message will be provided instead.

anyExCat: [Array<String>]
	- Applied roles will not be able to roll in any listed category.
	- Only for commands of the "Any" category.
	- This will not affect commands of other categories.

cannotRoll: Boolean
	- Any role marked with this will be completely excluded from role rolling.
	- Other modifiers, such as to spawn rate, will be completely ignored.

spawnCat: "String" | [Array<String>]
	- If this is specified, the role will spawn within the provided Category/ies, rather than its actual category.
	- This will override the special behavior attributed to the "Any" category.
	- If "Any" is within the spawnCat list, it will have its special behavior applied to it.
	- Has no effect on the listing or displaying of a command's category.

spawnRate: Number
	- A multiplier that determines how often, relative to other roles, that this role will be chosen.
	- Decimal values are acceptable, but will be rounded to the nearest 0.001 if necessary.
	- A value of 0 or below will prevent the role from spawning.

spawnSubCat: "String" | [Array<String>]
	- If this is specified, the role will spawn within the provided subcategory/ies, rather than its subCat.
	- If both this and subCat are Arrays, absolutely any cat+subcat combination will be acceptable for specifying what can be rolled.
	- Has no effect on the listing or displaying of a command's subCat.

subCat: "String"
	- Allows for further division and specification of a command's category.
	- Applies to rolling, listing, and various other areas where information about a command may be displayed.
	- Determines default color and icon of the command's embed.

syncCats: Boolean
	- Only has an effect on roles that have both spawnCat and spawnSubCat as Arrays.
	- As long as this is active, the position of listed categories and subcategories will be checked when rolling for commands.
	- Category 1 and subCat 1 must match, or Category 2 and subCat 2 must match, etc.
	- Any match where the number is different, such as Category 1 and subCat 2, will be ignored.
